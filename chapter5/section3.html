      The Ottoman Empire would have two major fronts in the Middle East. These fronts would last the entire war, and would occur in Palestine, Sinai, Iraq and Syria. The war in the Middle East only really broke out as the British Empire had to defend its faraway claims. The Sinai canal was an important route that allowed their ships to skip going around Africa, while in the Persian Sea they had to defend India and their oil fields. The oil fields would be important as they fueled the new machines of WWI.

    <p>  The Mesopotamia Campaign would occur in the deserts and marshes that were located around the rivers that were the cradle of civilization. The Tigris and Euphrates was were most Turkish claims were while the desserts were mostly unclaimed. The British would start the campaign in 1914, by assaulting Fao Fortress, and around the same time Kuwait would join the war on the side of the British. By the end of the year the British would control the city of Basra. This would protect the British oil fields. The Ottomans did not put much effort in this campaign due to their resources being spent in Gallipoli, Palestine and the Caucasus. 1915 would result in mostly losses for the Ottomans with the British pushing for Baghdad. 1915 would end with the battle of Kut, where the British would defend an isolated town and would last until April 1916. This would result in a loss for the British. This alongside with Gallipoli resulted in the British reinforcing their Middle Eastern fights, to prevent another massive loss. In 1917, the British would retake Kut, and would liberate Baghdad in mid-March.  1918 was rather eventless compared to the prior years, but was due to more battles occurring in the Palestine region.

    <p>  The Palestine and Sinai Campaign would be where most of the fighting in the Middle East would occur, though the other campaigns had an impact. It was where the Arab Revolt would occur alongside battles that would push back the Ottomans until the end of the war. The Suez Canal would be where this theatre started and battling here would last until 1916. The battle of Romani would mark the end of the battle for the Suez, and the campaign would be on the offensive until March 1917 at the battle of Gaza. The campaign in Sinai would end in early 1917, as the rest of the battles would occur through Palestine. The Sykes-Picot agreement was made to split the Middle East into two partitions one for France and one for Britain. This was done as the British continued to have success in this theatre of war.  The Arab Revolution with the assistance of T.E Lawrence would occur and many arabs would join the fight against the Ottomans. They opposed the Ottoman rule and wanted to have their own land, which the British supported.

      The Persian Campaign occurred in the initially neutral Persia. The objective of the campaign in this region was due to need of fuel resources. The forces that fought in this theatre were mostly Persians, British, Russians and Ottomans. Most of the fighting in 1914 was fought near the Caucasus region where Russia and the Ottomans fought. The Russians would have an offensive where they lost but would have a victory at Sarikamish. In 1915, a Wilhelm Wassmuss, a German consul, urged natives in Persia to fight against the British but didn't have much success. The Russians were on the retreat after their victory, and the Ottomans marched towards Persia and started to occupy towns in 1915. The Russians would come back in northern Persia and would hold the line. The Russians would occupy the Tehran, which made the rest of 1915 have not much conflict. In 1916 the Russians would continue to push forward in Persia with victories, but would be forced to retreat The British would help their Russian Allies in southern Persia. The revolutions in Russia would force the Russian military to stop operating in the region. The Armenians and British would continue to fight in Persia until the end of the war but no victory would change the impact of the war.
