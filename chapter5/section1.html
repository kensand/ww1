    	The United States was already part of the war. Though not in combat, the United States was a major supplier for the Allies and Central Powers initially in the war. This would change, after the British blockaded the German ports preventing trade to occur. The United States already favored the Entente/Allies, but as a country of immigrants the United States had supporters of both sides. The United States would also have backlash of entering the war. Before WWI, the United States was isolated from European politics and wars, and for many they wanted to keep it that way. But under the President Woodrow Wilson, he would push to join the war under the ideals of making European peace important.

    Though the main reason for joining the war was the return of the German U-boats. After the sinking of the Lusitania in 1915, where US citizens died, the Germans would stop their un-restricted U-Boat warfare. In 1917 they would relaunch this idea, as they were getting desperate to stop the Allies trade of supplies. The last straw for the United States was the Zimmerman Telegram. It was from Germany sent to Mexico, promising the states of New Mexico and Arizona to the country if they would join the Central powers and fight the United States. This was intercepted by the British and would send this to the United States. With these two reasons alongside a growing population that wanted to help their relatives in Europe the United States would enter WWI on April 6th 1917.

    The American military would start to draft citizens into the war, and started to modernize their military for this war. Many of the iconic imagery of the United States military was made during this time, including the image of Uncle Sam. A massive way of propaganda would occur in the United States, encouraging patriotism and assisting the country in their entry into WWI. War Bonds were bought to give money to the United States so they could spend it on rapid militarization.
