    Germany was on its last stand, with the Russians removed and the Americans coming to reinforce the western front they had one last battle to win the war. Their spring offensive would get them close to victory, but the Allies stood their ground and were able to push past the german defenses in a counter attack. By November 11th, the war was over and peace could began. Other events transpired in 1918, including the Italian victory over Austria-Hungary, and the final pushes to victory in the Middle East.
