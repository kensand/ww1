      In late 1915, the Allied forces decided to launch an offensive on the German controlled Somme, in 1916. The French were supposed to be a major part of this operation, but the German assault at Verdun, would force the British to be the major power in this battle. On July 1st, the artillery bombardment by the Allies would last for a week, before the British soldiers would charge the line, but were mowed down by German guns. On the first day of the Somme, the British would have 20,000 soldiers’ dead and another 40,000 wounded. The battle would continue to be a slow push forward for the British, but always at the cost of more casualties.
