      The western front between Germany and the Entente was a stalemate of war, both sides were throwing their armies at each other but no decisive victories. One of the larger campaigns to happen in 1915 on this front was the Second Battle of Ypres. This battle would last for one month in the Belgian town Ypres. The series of battles that occurred around Ypres would have a lot of firsts. The Second Battle of Ypres would start by Germans using chemical weapons. The use of chlorine gas, would cause around 6,000 causalities for the French.  The battle would continue onward with gas clouds being used to clear trenches and give the Germans surprise attacks due to low visibility. It would be in July that the Entente soldiers would receive proper gasmasks. Towards the end of this battle, the Germans unleashed another new weapon, the Flammenwerfer. The portable flamethrower would make its appearance at the battle.

    <p>  Even with these new technologies, they were not any more effective than rifles at lethality. Only about 3% of chemical attacks were lethal, but still caused massive injuries to soldiers. Unlike any other war, soldiers were experiencing a living hell. Trenches were full of waste, dead bodies, and in some of them full of water. Disease was rampant due to the low hygiene, rats, and bugs. Trenches were also the target of artillery and gas attacks. Many soldiers were getting shell shock from all of this. Shell shock symptoms were all over the place from fatigue, confusion, insomnia, panic, and often  a thousand yard stare. As research went on, shell shock would be identified as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Shell shock would be treated by removal from battle, but some cases were seen as cowardice
