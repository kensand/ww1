    There are many reasons that World War I became as big as it got. What started as a regional war in the Balkans became a war across Europe and is often cited that due to the intricate alliances that this war became international. Diplomacy is important, making friends and alliances often prevents nations from invading one another and having beneficial trade. Its why NATO exists today as it is a way for many nations to work together and protect one another. For example if a Baltic Country like Estonia or Latvia were invaded by Russia, NATO nations would react and defend their ally. Though in World War I there were a lot less nations participating in these broad alliances. Where NATO is composed of 28 nations, the Entente was just three nations.
The Triple Entente was between Russia, Britain and France, which was formed in 1907 to counteract the Triple Alliance of Germany, Austro-Hungary and Italy. So when war was to break out, all nations would declare war on one another besides Italy, who believed the Triple Alliance was for defensive wars not offensive wars, Italy later on would join the Entente. The United State of America stood back in the early part of this war due to a longstanding isolationistic view on Europe known as the Monroe Doctrine but due to German U-boats that would change as the war went on and the USA would start supporting the Entente.
