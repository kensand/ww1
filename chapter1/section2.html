      Many people forget that Germany is a relatively young nation compared to France, Russia and Britain. The region of Germany before its unification was composed of various independent states and two Empires, Austria and Prussia.

After occupying Paris, France would surrender, and after the war, the German Empire would become one of the strongest powers in Europe. Many Europeans saw this as a problem, but due to their horrific defeat France would start to build up better defenses in case Germany planned to take more French land, and the Germans took note of this and would plan around it in World War 1, by attacking through Belgium. Both sides were not prepared for the hell that their next war would bring.
