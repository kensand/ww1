    World War I was the war to end all wars, but as we can see today that never came true. The four year span of military conflict was not just between Germany and the Allied Forces, but spread across Europe, Africa, The Middle East and the Pacific Ocean. Almost all major nations played a part in this event and still mourn the fallen or remember the scars that this war created. During this war, new technologies would alter the battlefield including mustard gas, planes, and tanks. After four years of fighting this war would end and forever change the world in both society and technology, but also the idea of war itself. The objective of this website is to explore the events and ideas that occurred during this war to see how World War I still matters today.
