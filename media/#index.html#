	      The nation of France was home to some of the bloodiest battles in the entire war, and to this day some places in western France are uninhabitable. It was the French who caused that last major European war with their leader Napoleon in the early 1800s, and now the tables were turned, where its Prussian neighbor was the invader not the defender. The French army at the start of the war wore their old uniforms that were bright blue compared to the germans that wore khakis. The French military would suffer massive casualties throughout the war, but would hold the line for over four years. Over the years the French would change their uniforms but also get support from their allies. France would be one of the victors in this war but not without major wounds. In total for France there were  6,160,800 casualties alongside various towns and villages being completely destroyed.

	      The nation of Italy was part of the Triple Alliance until 1915, where it did not help its allies Germany and Austria-Hungary as their Alliance was a defensive one. Italy would join the Entente after getting the promise of regaining lost Territory from the Austro-Hungarians. The Italian front would be fought in the mountainous border, where trenches were built into mountains. The Italians and Austro-Hungarians would fight until the end of the war in a stalemate, where a collapsing Austro-Hungary retreated. The Italians would have major casualties with a total of 2,197,000. The Italians would only get some of the land they were supposed to get, causing internal problems. Alongside with a post war economy, the country would revolt and be run by a fascist government in 1922.

	      The German Empire was a problem for Europe, having only recently become a country, Germany had one of the strongest land militaries as they were properly trained and one of the strongest industries to support their soldiers. They saw WWI as a way to show their strength to their rivals in the Entente. Their victory against the French in 1871 where in 6 months they would seige Paris, would inspire the German army to have a repeat victory and make the war swift. The Germans were not prepared for the war that last over four years, which caused massive problems economically. The Germans had great victories and great losses throughout the war, but in the end would lose the war. The treaties that followed after the war made Germany the main blame for the entire war, where it was their ally Austria-Hungary that invaded Serbia, and due to honor would assist their ally. The total casualties for Germany were 7,142,558, which was over 60% of their entire army. The post war Germany would suffer drastically enough to allow a man like Hitler to rise to power and aim to make Germany great again at whatever the cost.

The Hungarians would revolt in 1849 and by 1867 would get their own government and would alongside the Austrian Empire. Others would attempt to revolt but with not the same success. Under the empire various ethnic groups populated it lands including germans, czechs, Hungarians, Poles, Ukrainians, Slovaks, Croats, Serbs, Slovenes, and Italians. Austria-Hungary was a weaker empire then the other super powers in World War I, they would have minor victories but often due to the germans aiding them.

The British would have initial victories but at a fort in Northern Kamerun called Mora it would be a standstill until the campaign ended. The British also invaded southern Kamerun but were pushed back by Germans at the battle of Nsanakong. Most German forces were defeated besides the ones stationed at Fort Mora and Fort Garua and went inland into the mountains.

          The Campaign in German East Africa would last the entire war, due to German resilience. The germans under the order of Paul Emil von Lettow-Vorbeck would last until four days after the German Armistice signed on November 11th, 1918. The German forces were mostly Askari which were, African native soldiers. The early conflicts went backand forth, but the largest battles were near the northern border. At the Battle of Kilimanjaro, the Germans would have another victory, but this battle was a distraction for the other offensive the British launched. The Battle of Tanga, was a massive British defeat with forces of 8,000. Were defeated by the 1,000 germans. Their intent to do an amphibious assault failed, and allowed for German East Africa to last longer than the other German colonies. Lettow-Vorbeck’s army would continue to be a problem as the British forces failed to capture his army. In 1917,  a change of command for the british would start to push back the Germans. With a couple of other battles between Germans and Allied forces, the final victory in Kasma on November 13th, 1918 would be the last conflict of WWI. Lettow would receive a telegram telling him of German defeat and would surrender on November 25th.
