            On August 9th, the British and French would invade the German colony of Togoland. French came from the east and British to the west, this two pronged attack would make this campaign rather short. The German defenses only lasted a few days and relocated to defend a radio station. But the defensive force was defeated on August 26, 1914.  Togoland at the end of the war would be separated between the British and French. And in 1960 it would gain independence from France and would be known as Togo.

            The German colony of Kamerun would be invaded by the French and British colonial forces on August 6th 1914 and would end on March 10th 1916. Initially the colony attempted to offer neutrality to the British and French, but was rejected. The British would have initial victories but at a fort in Northern Kamerun called Mora it would be a standstill until the campaign ended. The British also invaded southern Kamerun but were pushed back by Germans at the battle of Nsanakong. Most German forces were defeated besides the ones stationed at Fort Mora and Fort Garua and went inland into the mountains. By the end of the year most of Kamerun was taken over, and in early 1916 the remaining Germans went to Spanish Guinea. The territory was then split between the British and French. This colony is now a nation called Cameroon.

            The Campaign in German East Africa would last the entire war, due to German resilience. The germans under the order of Paul Emil von Lettow-Vorbeck would last until four days after the German Armistice signed on November 11th, 1918. The German forces were mostly Askari which were, African native soldiers. The early conflicts went backand forth, but the largest battles were near the northern border. At the Battle of Kilimanjaro, the Germans would have another victory, but this battle was a distraction for the other offensive the British launched. The Battle of Tanga, was a massive British defeat with forces of 8,000. Were defeated by the 1,000 germans. Their intent to do an amphibious assault failed, and allowed for German East Africa to last longer than the other German colonies. Lettow-Vorbeck’s army would continue to be a problem as the British forces failed to capture his army. In 1917,  a change of command for the british would start to push back the Germans. With a couple of other battles between Germans and Allied forces, the final victory in Kasma on November 13th, 1918 would be the last conflict of WWI. Lettow would receive a telegram telling him of German defeat and would surrender on November 25th.

The British would lose a protected cruiser and a tugboat would be damaged due to the Konigsberg’s guns outranging the British. The Konigsberg’s engine would fail so it would take refuge in the Runfiji Delta, and the British would spot this. The British this time had the upper hand in ships, including four cruisers, a pre-dreadnaught and two monitors. The Konigsberg was surrounded on July 11th 1915 the ship would be sunken.

            The Western borders of German East Africa would be another battleground where naval warfare and Belgian offensives would lead to German defeat. At the battle of Lake Tanganyika various boats would battle with small guns, and would lead to a Allied victory, the germans would scuttle their ships and take their guns and use them in their future battles. Belgian Congo was to the west of German East Africa and the Belgians would conscript natives from the region to fight for them. Belgian soldiers would have major victories by pushing back the Germans to their town of Tabora. The German defeat at Tabora would lead to the Ruanda-Urundi territory being controlled by Belgians. The Belgians would assist the British in the rest of the campaign in East Africa from 1917-1918.
