	    The small nation of Belgium was neutral before the war, and was allied with Britain. It was the invasion by Germany that would force the British to enter the war, aid their allies of Belgium and France in World War I. The German invasion was caused by the Belgians not allowing to just pass through, this forced the Germans to attack the neutral nation. The Belgians were able to hold off the German Army for a month, giving the Entente time to prepare for the German offensives. Various cities in Belgium were destroyed by the war including Ypres. By the end the war, Belgium would have 93,061 casualties. Belgium would be liberated and would slowly repair from the war.

	    The German Empire was a problem for Europe, having only recently become a country, Germany had one of the strongest land militaries as they were properly trained and one of the strongest industries to support their soldiers. They saw WWI as a way to show their strength to their rivals in the Entente. Their victory against the French in 1871 where in 6 months they would seige Paris, would inspire the German army to have a repeat victory and make the war swift. The Germans were not prepared for the war that last over four years, which caused massive problems economically. The Germans had great victories and great losses throughout the war, but in the end would lose the war. The treaties that followed after the war made Germany the main blame for the entire war, where it was their ally Austria-Hungary that invaded Serbia, and due to honor would assist their ally. The total casualties for Germany were 7,142,558, which was over 60% of their entire army. The post war Germany would suffer drastically enough to allow a man like Hitler to rise to power and aim to make Germany great again at whatever the cost.

	    After a horrible loss to the Japanese in a prior war in 1904, Russia was continuing down an unstable path and aimed to gain strength in  victory against their European neighbors if war was to break out. The military of Russia was the largest initially, but were poorly trained and equipped. After major losses, the Russians would have over 5 million casualties or prisoners of war. In Early 1917, Russia’s government would collapse due to revolution and by the end of the year the Bolsheviks would take over and install a new government.

	    The nation of France was home to some of the bloodiest battles in the entire war, and to this day some places in western France are uninhabitable. It was the French who caused that last major European war with their leader Napoleon in the early 1800s, and now the tables were turned, where its Prussian neighbor was the invader not the defender. The French army at the start of the war wore their old uniforms that were bright blue compared to the germans that wore khakis. The French military would suffer massive casualties throughout the war, but would hold the line for over four years. Over the years the French would change their uniforms but also get support from their allies. France would be one of the victors in this war but not without major wounds. In total for France there were  6,160,800 casualties alongside various towns and villages being completely destroyed.
