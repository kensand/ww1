	  The nation of France was home to some of the bloodiest battles in the entire war, and to this day some places in western France are uninhabitable. It was the French who caused that last major European war with their leader Napoleon in the early 1800s, and now the tables were turned, where its Prussian neighbor was the invader not the defender. The French army at the start of the war wore their old uniforms that were bright blue compared to the germans that wore khakis. The French military would suffer massive casualties throughout the war, but would hold the line for over four years. Over the years the French would change their uniforms but also get support from their allies. France would be one of the victors in this war but not without major wounds. In total for France there were  6,160,800 casualties alongside various towns and villages being completely destroyed.
