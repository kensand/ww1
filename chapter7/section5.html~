       100 years ago, on April 2nd 1917, Woodrow Wilson, would address congress with a very powerful message to move the United States to war against the German Empire. He said this powerful quote: “We have no quarrel with the German people. We have no feeling towards them but one of sympathy and friendship. It was not upon their impulse that their Government acted in entering this war. It was not with their previous knowledge or approval. It was a war determined upon as wars used to be determined upon in the old, unhappy days when peoples were nowhere consulted by their rulers and wars were provoked and waged in the interest of dynasties or of little groups of ambitious men who were accustomed to use their fellow men as pawns and tools.”

    Wilson’s message maybe one of the most important quotes to take out of this entire war. America’s entry in World War I was to create permanent peace and remove leaders who would use their people as pawns. Though in reality this would never occur, due to corruption and evil leader’s being able to usurp or rise to power in their countries and repeat history. It may be in human nature that war is in our blood, but at best it must be important for us to look back at the events of World War I and attempt to not repeat a war that escalated from a regional one in the Balkans to a global affair. The total casualties of WWI were 35 million, many countries lost a large chunk of a generation due to the war, it’s important to remember that 100 years ago the world was at war, and hopefully an event like this won’t occur again.  It’s your job to stay informed about the news and learn about both sides of the battle and realize that often enough most soldiers are just fighting to protect their homeland and are no different than you.
