    1915 was a good year for the Central Powers, even with the loss of Italy, the central powers would gain the aid of the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria. The western front was mostly in stalemate due to trench warfare, but with new technologies the war got worse or the soldier on the ground. The Entente would start its campaign against the Ottoman Empire, with a major defeat at Gallipoli, but other victories elsewhere. The Russians would lose Poland due to a joint offensive from Austria-Hungary and Germany.
